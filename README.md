# Solution

Task 1 
	
  It was solved by using Power BI connected to sql server; Power Bi file is too big to attache - the summary presentation (Task 1) with screenshots was done instead (PowerBi is available upon request)

Task 2 
	
  It was solved by combining csv in python  then uploading combined file to dbfour; sql request (order_id_list_with_diff) should provide the differences 
  
  	thank you!
